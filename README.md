## Synopsys

**_Otto_** is a developer's dream, it automatically builds a development environment tailored specifically for developer's application, with zero or minimal configuration. It knows how to develop and deploy any application on any cloud platform, all controlled with a single consistent workflow.

It detects the type of application you're developing and configures that development environment for you. For example, if you're developing a PHP application, Otto will automatically install PHP and other related tools for you. It automatically downloads, installs, configures, and starts dependencies in your development environments for you.

## Key Features
* **Automatic development environments** by automatically detecting application type and services, and then building a development environment tailored specifically for that application and also configuring and starting required services in your development environment for you.

* **Built for Microservices** by understanding dependencies & versioning, then automatically deploying and configuring those dependincies for any enviornment.

* **Deployment:** It knows how to deploy applications and can deploy them in any enviornment.

* **Docker:** Otto can use Docker to download and start dependencies for development to simplify microservices. Applications can be containerized automatically to make deployments easier without changing the developer workflow.

* **Production-hardened tooling:** Otto automatically installs and manages production-hardened tooling to build development environments (Vagrant), launch servers (Terraform), configure services (Consul), and more.
